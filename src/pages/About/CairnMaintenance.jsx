  <p id="Title"> Positive Reinforcement Training </p>
  <div id="AboutContent">
  <img className="headerImage" src={bearkayaking} />

 Positive Reinforcement Training or PRT I feel is the best and only way to train any breed, big or small. 
            The main concept behind it consists of only rewarding positive behavior and discouraging any negative or bad behavior by not reinforcing it. 
            While training using the PRT method no physical abuse like slapping or hitting should ever be needed. 
            PRT is more effective than any other training method I have found and means that there should never be slapping, hitting, or shocking.
 <br />
    <br />
            
 A few tips: when training, avoid using their main source of food as a reward or this can lead to food bowl aggression. 
            Also, when or if your puppy does something bad like pee on the floor or chew something they shouldn't, DO NOT slap or hit them. 
            Just guide them outdoors and reinforce the behavior of them going to the bathroom outside by rewarding them. 
            Having a routine for you and the puppy helps as well. 
            A good way to help avoid unwanted chewing is to help make sure they have toys of their own that aren't similar to other items in the house. 
            And finally, again, and this applies from Cairns all the way up to Mastiffs: you never need to hit a dog to teach it.

  <p id="Title">Vaccines & Medications</p>
  <div id="AboutContent">

Do what your veterinarian recommends as certain vaccines are more crucial to have in different parts of the country than others. 
            Certain parts of the country have different types of potential dangers. 
            For example, some parts of the country have wood ticks while others do not. 
            Another example being that some areas with specific climates and winter temperatures are home to parasitic worms, too, since they can thrive there. 
 <br />
    <br />
 Parasites like heartworm are commonly transmitted from being on a mosquito's mouth to your puppy when it bites. 
            When I am traveling with them, they will have to use shared pet relief areas, so I administer a prevention medication for fleas and ticks as well as hookworm, ringworm, and heartworm. 
            I personally use Trifexis for a once a month pill for prevention for all of the above.

<div id="AboutContent">

    Just like most other dogs, Cairns do not like to be left alone. 
            If they are left alone for extended periods of time you can experience destructive behavior from your Cairn like barking, not listening, possible attitude, etc. 
            Mine will often give me "the look" like where have you been and what took you so long.
    <br />
    <br />
  They are just like people too, they need and crave your time and attention. 
            A good solution if you need to be away is to leave the light and the tv on when you are gone for longer periods. 
            Most of the time our Cairns come with us into stores, on planes, and pretty much everywhere, as they are also my children's service animals, and have helped them in more ways than I ever imagined!
